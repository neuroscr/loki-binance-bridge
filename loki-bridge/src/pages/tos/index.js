<h2>The Platform</h2>
<p>1. The website wLoki Bridge, and any related mobile applications, (collectively "Platform") is owned, operated and controlled by Alchemy Luxe of Flat B, 8/F, Blk 6, Villa Carlton, 369 Tai Po Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong, trading as wLoki Bridge, who along with its associated entities, and each of their directors, affiliates or employees (as appropriate) are referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” in these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>2. The Platform provided and operated by wLoki Bridge allows users to deposit particular digital currencies and directly swap them for an equivalent on an alternate blockchain. “wLoki Bridge” may also refer to the services, website, mobile applications, content, products or any other services provided by wLoki Bridge (collectively “Services”).</p>
<p>3. By making a transaction to the address specified on the website in order to use the Services provided by wLoki Bridge, you expressly represent and warrant that you have accepted our Terms of Use, and any additional terms and conditions displayed on the Platform (including without limitation our Privacy Policy and AML-CTF Policy) as they apply from time to time.</p>
<p>4. We grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable licence to use the software on a server controlled by us for the sole purpose of accessing and obtaining the material on the Platform.</p>
<p>5. We may amend, modify, add to, or delete these Terms of Use at our discretion and those amendments, modifications, additions or deletions apply to your use of the Platform and Services as soon as they are displayed on the Platform (whether or not you are aware of those amendments, modifications, additions or deletions). All subsequent transactions by you will be subject to the amended and most current Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Risks of Trading and Holding Crypto or Digital Currencies</h2>
<p>7. The trading or holding of coins, tokens, crypto, digital currency, or digital assets of the like (collectively "Coins") involves significant risks and the losses can be substantial. You should carefully consider and assess whether holding Coins is suitable for you depending upon your financial circumstances and tolerance to risk.</p>
<p>8. Coins such as Loki, Ethereum, and wLoki are unlike traditional currencies, goods, or commodities in the market and are subject to exceptional risks. Unlike other traditional forms of currency, Coins are decentralised and are not backed by a central bank, government or legal entities and remain unregulated. As such, the value of Coins may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions, confidence of investors, competing currencies, regulatory announcements or changes, technical problems, or any other factors.</p>
<p>9. Due to the significant risks of using Coins as well as the impact of technology and the international market, wLoki Bridge cannot warrant or guarantee that particular Coins will be available on our Platform and Services. wLoki Bridge reserves the right to stop offering Services in relation to particular Coins on our Platform and Services. We will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you if we cease to support particular Coins. If this is the case, you will not be able to convert Coins into any other currency using this platform any longer, and will have to convert the Coins through another user, platform, or third party website.</p>
<p>10. wLoki Bridge only supports mechanisms such as Metacoins, Alt-Coins, Forks, Sidechains, Colour Coins, or any other Coins which supplement and interact with digital currency, if wLoki Bridge explicitly specifies through our Platform. The Platform will participate in Forks, wLoki Bridge’s absolute discretion.</p>
<p>11. wLoki Bridge is not responsible or liable for any Coins once they are transferred from our Platform to another site, device, platform or user. Nor is wLoki Bridge responsible or liable for any Coins not converted on our Platform that have been sent into our Platform or Coins that have been sent to an incorrect wallet address or a wallet address for a different Coin. It is important for you to take precautions when transferring and storing your Coins whether on our platform or through other sites, wallets or devices. We take no responsibility for misappropriation or theft of your Coins. You should familiarise yourself with the security measures available when using a wallet service or other device for storage. Always take a greater degree of care and precaution to secure your passwords when operating in a digital environment.</p>
